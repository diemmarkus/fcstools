#First Release

= Introduction =

The FCSTools is releasing its first Tarball (actually a zip file)!


= Details =

This is the first release of the FCSTools utilities. The tarball contains the pertinent files from the SVN repository (which can be browsed elsewhere on the site). This tarball is of revision 40 and is known to compile on Mac OS X 10.4.10 with GCC 4.0.1 (Apple build 5367).

There is no reason it should not compile on any reasonably compliant C++ compiler.

Included in this release are five utilities:
  * [FCSInfo fcsinfo] _provides a brief summary and information about FCS2.0 and FCS3.0 files_
  * [FCSConvert fcsconvert] _provides a number of utilities for manipulating FCS- 2.0 and 3.0 files_
  * [FCSTest fcstest] _small test suite to make sure FCS- 2.0 and 3.0 files survive a round-trip_
  * [FCS2FCHR fcstofchr] and [FCS2FCHR fchrtofcs] _converts between FCS- 2.0 and 3.0 files and a human-readable format; [FCHR FCHR] is a much easier to parse and use_
