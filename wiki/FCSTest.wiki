#fcstest

= FCSTest =

fcstest performs a "round-trip" on your data. That is:

*>* fcstest sample1.fcs

Results in a file being created called "Result.fcs2". This file should be (similar) if not identical to the input file. If it is not, please send us a bug report!

The code for fcstest is trivially short, so we will include it here and describe the parts of it:

{{{
#include<fstream>
#include"FCSIO.hpp"

int main (int argc, char *argv[])
{

  using namespace FCSTools;

  if (argc != 2)
    return 0;

  std::ifstream fcsfile (argv[1], std::ios::in|std::ios::binary);
  FCS<std::size_t> fcs = Reader<std::size_t> (fcsfile);
  
  std::ofstream ofcsfile ("Result.fcs2", std::ios::out|std::ios::binary);
  Writer (ofcsfile, fcs);

  return 0;
}
